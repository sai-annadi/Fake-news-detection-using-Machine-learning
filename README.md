# Fake-news-detection-using-Machine-learning

This project is dedicated to crafting an advanced fake news detection system using machine learning techniques. Through a diverse dataset encompassing both real and false news articles, the aim is to engineer a potent model capable of accurately distinguishing between authentic and misleading information. The process involves merging datasets, employing TF-IDF vectorization for text-to-numeric conversion, and mitigating class imbalance using SMOTE.

The project's core revolves around constructing robust model pipelines that streamline the evaluation of diverse machine learning algorithms. These pipelines seamlessly integrate preprocessing, model training, and prediction, allowing for systematic experimentation. Performance evaluation hinges on pivotal metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and the confusion matrix, guiding the selection and refinement of the most effective model for identifying instances of fake news articles. Ultimately, this project strives to contribute significantly to the fight against misinformation by offering an adept solution for detecting fabricated news, inviting active participation and collaboration to enhance news classification accuracy in the digital landscape.
