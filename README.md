# Fake-news-detection-using-Machine-learning

## Overview

This project is dedicated to crafting a fake news detection system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a robust model capable of accurately distinguishing between authentic and misleading information by utilizing a diverse dataset containing both real and false news articles.

## Key Features

### 1. Dataset Integration

- Merging diverse datasets to create a comprehensive and representative dataset for training and testing the model.

### 2. Text-to-Numeric Conversion

- Employing TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to convert textual data into numerical features, which are essential for machine learning algorithms.

### 3. Class Imbalance Mitigation

- Addressing class imbalance issues using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to ensure balanced and fair model training.

### 4. Model Pipelines

- Constructing robust model pipelines that streamline the evaluation of diverse machine learning algorithms.
- Integration of preprocessing, model training, and prediction in these pipelines for systematic experimentation.

### 5. Performance Metrics

- Evaluating model performance using pivotal metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and the confusion matrix.
- These metrics guide the selection and refinement of the most effective model for identifying instances of fake news articles.
